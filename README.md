This Eclipse project contains code to run on a laptop 'coprocessor' on a First Robotics
FRC robot.

The code provides a means to execute vision processoring for a robot in both autonomous and
tele-operated modes and makes use of OpenCV for image processing.

The program communicates with the robot using First's NetworkTables protocol.
